//php7.1.1

index.php is the main file--you should be able to run that out of the gate.  I'm not sure how github stores sqlite3 DBs, So
you may need to uncomment my dropTable function if the database is already populated.  Once you create the database once you should leave that uncommented 
or it will just continue to add to it.

Hopefully everything is pretty self-explanatory.  test.php has some example usage of my classes but they should be pretty easy to understand,
I tried to keep things simple while showing functionality.

Please don't hesitate to ask me if you have any questions about anything, want me to elaborate on anything, or want me to keep going and add 
some more!  At the least, this project has been a great learning experience for me. 

Disclaimer: This is my first time ever really writing anything *substantial*(outside of a course or tutorial) in PHP, so please excuse any really weird things I did or lack of 
best practices (...although from what I can tell so far--PHP doesn't have any best practices...)
